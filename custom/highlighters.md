# Highlighters

Slidev comes with three syntax highlighters for you to choose from:

- [Prism](https://prismjs.com/)
- [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki)
- [Shikiji](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji)

**Prism** is one of the most popular syntax highlighters. The highlighting is done by adding token classes to the code and it's colored using CSS. You can browse through their [official themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes), or create/customize one yourself very easily using [`prism-theme-vars`](https://github.com/antfu/prism-theme-vars).

**Shiki**, on the other hand, is a TextMate grammar-powered syntax highlighter. It generates colored tokens, so there is no additional CSS needed. Since it has great grammar support, the generated colors are very accurate, just like what you will see in VS Code. Shiki also comes with [a bunch of built-in themes](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/master/docs/themes.md). The downside of Shiki is that it also requires TextMate themes (compatible with VS Code theme) to do the highlighting, which can be a bit harder to customize.

**Shikiji** is an ESM rewrite of Shiki bringing many improvements and new features. You could have [AST-based transformers](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji#hast-transformers) to customize how the code is rendered. And the [TwoSlash](#twoslash) support is also built-in.

Slidev themes usually support both Prism and Shiki, but depending on the theme you are using, it might only support one of them.

When you have the choice, the tradeoff is basically:

- **Prism** for easier customization
- **Shiki** for more accurate highlighting
- **Shikiji** on top of Shiki, it also enables [TwoSlash](#twoslash) support and custom transformers addons. 

Slidev uses Prism by default for compatibility. We recommend using Shikiji for more accurate and feature-rich highlighting, you can switch to it by adding the following to your `slides.md`:

```yaml
---
highlighter: shikiji
---
```

## TwoSlash Integration

This feature is only available when you set `highlighter` to `shikiji`.

[TwoSlash](https://www.typescriptlang.org/dev/twoslash/) is a powerful tool for rendering TypeScript code blocks with type information on hover or inlined. It's quite useful for preparing slides for JavaScript/TypeScript-related topics.

To use it, you can add `twoslash` to the code block's language identifier:

~~~md
```ts twoslash
console.log('hello')
```
~~~

An example of TwoSlash enabled code snippet [can be found here](https://antfu.me/posts/shikiji-twoslash).

## Configure Prism

To configure your Prism, you can just import the theme CSS or use [`prism-theme-vars`](https://github.com/antfu/prism-theme-vars) to configure themes for both light and dark mode. Refer to its docs for more details.

## Configure Shiki

<Environment type="node" />

Create `./setup/shiki.ts` file with the following content

```ts
/* ./setup/shiki.ts */
import { defineShikiSetup } from '@slidev/types'

export default defineShikiSetup(() => {
  return {
    theme: {
      dark: 'min-dark',
      light: 'min-light',
    },
  }
})
```

Refer to [Shiki's docs](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/master/docs/themes.md#all-themes) for available theme names.

Or if you want to use your own theme:

```ts
/* ./setup/shiki.ts */

import { defineShikiSetup } from '@slidev/types'

export default defineShikiSetup(async({ loadTheme }) => {
  return {
    theme: {
      dark: await loadTheme('path/to/theme.json'),
      light: await loadTheme('path/to/theme.json'),
    },
  }
})
```

## Configure Shikiji

<Environment type="node" />

Create `./setup/shikiji.ts` file with the following content:

```ts
/* ./setup/shikiji.ts */
import { defineShikijiSetup } from '@slidev/types'

export default defineShikijiSetup(() => {
  return {
    themes: {
      dark: 'vitesse-dark',
      light: 'vitesse-light',
    },
    transformers: [
      ...
    ]
  }
})
```

Refer to [Shikiji's docs](https://github.com/antfu/shikiji) for all available options.

> It makes it easier for the community to adapt, when no `shikiji.ts` is presented, we will look for `shiki.ts` and try to convert it to Shikiji options.
